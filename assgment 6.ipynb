    "Ans. Using a deque (double-ended queue) from the collec ons module to implement a \n",
    "queue instead of a regular Python list offers several advantages: \n",
    "Performance: \n",
    "# Optimized for end operations: Deques excel at adding and removing elements from \n",
    "both ends (appendleft and popleft) with a time complexity of O(1). This is crucial for \n",
    "queues, which follow a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. \n",
    "# List manipulation cost: \n",
    "Lists, while allowing insertions and removals, become \n",
    " inefficient for frequent operations at the beginning (e.g., insert(0, value), pop(0)) due \n",
    "to internal shifting of elements. This leads to a time complexity of O(n) in the worst \n",
    "case. \n",
    "#Functionality: \n",
    "  Designed for queues: Deques inherently support adding elements to both ends and \n",
    "removing from the front, perfectly aligning with the concept of a queue. Lists require \n",
    "additional work to mimic this behaviour. \n",
    "#Memory Management: \n",
    "  Efficient resizing: Deques handle growing and shrinking queues effectively without \n",
    "unnecessary memory reallocation, unlike lists that might incur overhead during \n",
    "resizing. \n",
    "#Thread Safety: \n",
    " Safer for multi-threaded environments: Deques offer thread-safe operations \n",
    "like append and popleft, making them suitable for concurrent access scenarios. Lists \n",
    "require additional synchronization mechanisms for thread safety. "

    "Ans2. Let's consider a scenario where you're building a web browser and implemen ng the \n",
    "func onality for the back bu on. \n",
    "In this scenario, a stack would be a more prac cal choice than a list for data storage and \n",
    "retrieval. Here's why: \n",
    "Assignment: - Data Structure \n",
    "1. Sequen al nature: When a user navigates through different web pages, the order of \n",
    "naviga on ma ers. Each me the user visits a new page, you would push that page onto \n",
    "the stack. This ensures that the pages are stored in the order they were visited, which is \n",
    "crucial for the back bu on func onality. \n",
    "2. LIFO (Last In, First Out) behaviour: The back bu on typically should take the user to the \n",
    "previous page they visited. Since a stack follows the LIFO principle, popping the topmost \n",
    "item from the stack would give you the last page visited. This perfectly aligns with the \n",
    "behaviour expected from the back bu on. \n",
    "3. Efficient retrieval: Retrieving the last page visited is a constant-me opera on with a \n",
    "stack. You simply pop the topmost item from the stack, and you have the page you need. \n",
    "This efficiency is par cularly important in scenarios where quick responsiveness is \n",
    "crucial, such as in a web browser. \n",
    "4. No random access needed: Unlike a list where you might need to access elements at \n",
    "arbitrary posi ons, with a stack, you only need to access the topmost element. This \n",
    "simplifies the implementa on and reduces unnecessary overhead associated with \n",
    "maintaining a list structure. \n",
    "5. Resource management: A stack can be more memory-efficient compared to a list if you \n",
    "only need to keep track of the immediate history for the back bu on func onality. It \n",
    "dynamically grows and shrinks as needed, accommoda ng the changing history of visited \n",
    "pages. "
